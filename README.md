# Password Generator

## Description

This project was not fully created by me. There was starter code given through my bootcamp. The CSS file wasn't properly linked for my files so i fixed that so the styling was fixed easily. I didn't edit anything in the HTML although it is a simple boiler plate with a few items. There were a few items like event listeners and buttons already in the javascript file. But I created all variabkles, loops, arrays, and other items. I learned a lot i feel like the loops and especially the for loop at the end that generates the password is what held me up. It is practically the same in Java but could not remember old experiences so i had to read documentation and figure it out so thats why it sees quite basic. This allows anyone to properly generate their own uniqque password all t=while selecting their own characteristics for it.
