# Password Generator

## Description

In this project I created the password generatto allow for a secure password to keep accounts safe for users. It essentially allows someone to choose amount of characters, special characters, numbers and evenc case for letters. This day in age security is the most important thing ever. This allows users to be comfortable with leaving their accounts alone without them being comprimised over a weak password.
